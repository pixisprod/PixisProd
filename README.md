# ✨ PixisProd

**`Serving logic. Forging structure. Standing by uptime.`**  

When it comes to code, I'm quite the **perfectionist**.
I love when **everything works 100% as intended**, and I often read *best practices* just to calm my soul, knowing that my code is **solid**.

I enjoy designing **project architecture**.
Even as a kid, I loved watching how engineers planned physical structures — now I do the same, just not with buildings, but with *systems*.
That’s exactly why I like **backend development**, especially **FastAPI** — it's *flexible* and doesn’t tie your hands, at least in terms of the architecture I value so much.

Recently, I’ve also found myself drawn to **ML/AI**. The process is quite different from backend work — and sure, *cleaning data* isn’t the most exciting part —
but the feeling of victory after hitting a **90%+ accuracy** metric makes it all **worth it**. It’s like watching a *small warrior* — one that quietly goes out, makes decisions, and gets things done.

In projects, I care about **scalability** and **code cleanliness**, because they let me focus on what matters without getting lost in repetitive tasks.
I dislike rewriting chunks of code (*not to be confused with refactoring*) just because something wasn’t well thought out in the beginning — partly because I’m afraid I might **miss something**, and partly because it’s **stressful** and **tedious** to me.
